# Validation of differentially methylated DNA regions in colorectal precancerous lesions

This repository harbors the code used for the processing and the analysis of (targeted) bisulfite sequencing data from a series of prospectively collected lesions.
All code used for the statistical analysis and the plots can be found in [analysis](https://github.com/emsonder/validation_dmrs/tree/main/analysis), code used for the alignment and methylation calls under [meth_calling](https://github.com/emsonder/validation_dmrs/tree/main/meth_calling). 

The dataset processed and analyzed is available under the following ArrayExpress accession: [E-MTAB-12612](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-12612).
